# THERE IS NOTHING OF OURS TO LINK. This line used to pull in a static library
# and drag the whole runtime into the plugin's DLL. Under the table model the
# only file of ours that takes part is the header `Conan/ConanPluginApi.h`,
# which is declarations only, so all that is left here is `-I`.
#
# INCLUDES ARE SEARCHED FOR, NEVER ASSUMED. This same file runs in two places
# with different shapes: the development tree (plugins/X/) and the SDK the
# community downloads (Exemplos/X/). It used to carry only the tree's path, so
# the FIRST command in the guide died with "ConanPluginApi.h: No such file" for
# everyone who downloaded it, while passing in here.
#
# ConanPermission.h deserves its own search because it lives in a DIFFERENT
# place in each: in the SDK it sits with the other headers; in the tree it stays
# with the plugin that publishes it (plugins/Permission/include). This script was
# once rewritten forgetting that, which broke UnlockEngrams in the tree without
# breaking it in the package.
